		(1) Weekly Release Enhancements:
			- These are shared from the respective snippets from the last month using the "n+1-enh" condition.
			- They should show up on two pages - last month's Weekly Update Preview, after that this month's Monthly Production.
			- These Weekly Update snippets are already mapped and conditioned in this snippet, so there's nothing you need to do as long as these items are conditioned "n+1-enh" in their respective Weekly Update snippet.
			
		(2) Items that will stay in Preview:
		 	- These items should show up on two pages - this month's Monthly Preview, and in the "preview-only-features" snippet after this month is over.
			- Apply "preview-only" condition on them.
			
		(3) Items that will be released to Preview and Production in the same release.
			- These items should show up in this month's Monthly Preview and Production.
			- Apply "n-only" condition on them.
			
		(4) Preview items from previous releases that will be released to Production 
			- Cut and paste these items from "preview-only-features.flsnp" to this file.
			- Apply "production-only" condition on them.

This template includes a magic link for a smoother sign-in experience. If email verification isn't immediately required to sign in to the application, Okta uses the <span class="uicontrol">Registration - Email Verification</span> template.
